            Hi! My name is Emma Secrest! I am a mathematician and a programmer from Indiana. I got my master's degree in mathematics in 2021.
            After which I recently picked up programming again.<br><br>
            I started my coding journey during my undergraduate years with C++. During my bachelor's, I lost my love of coding and did not discover it again until my master's, where I worked with R and Matlab. Through those languages, I rediscovered my love of coding and programming. 
            After graduation, I dove full force into coding. I began self-studying software engineering, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>
            In my free time, I enjoy cooking and gaming. I am also an amateur MUA!
